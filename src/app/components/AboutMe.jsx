                I’m an undergraduate student at Sanata Dharma University, Bangkit 2023 Batch 1 Cloud Computing participant, Bangkit 2023 Batch 2 Mobile Dev Participant.
                I am a lover of tech, tea and all its wonders. I marvel at the power of cloud computing, Back-end dev, UI/UX and the infinite possibilities it offers. I delight in learning new things and expanding my horizons. I cherish writing and art as forms of expression and creativity.
